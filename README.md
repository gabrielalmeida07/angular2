<h1><b>Tutorial: Tour of Heroes
 </b></h1>

Before you begin, make sure you are using the MEAN-STACK software package. In this release you can also use only Angular2 and Nodejs on your machine to run the project.

You can access all of this at: https://angular.io/.

The Tour of Heroes application covers the main fundamentals of Angular. You will create a basic application that has many of the features you would expect to find in a complete data-driven application: acquiring and displaying a list of heroes, editing the details of a selected hero, and navigating between different Heroic Data views.

You'll use built-in directives to show and hide elements and display hero data lists. You will create components to display hero details and show a series of heroes. You will use a one-way data connection for read-only data. You will add editable fields to update a model with bidirectional data binding. You will link component methods to user events, such as keystrokes and clicks. You'll enable users to select a hero from a master list and edit this hero in detail view. You format the data with the tubes. You will create a shared service to assemble the heroes. And you'll use routing to navigate between different views and their components.

You'll learn angular angular enough to get started and gain confidence that Angular can do what you need to do. You will receive a lot of ground on an introductory level, and you will find many links to pages in greater depth.
